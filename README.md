# devedge/xmlrpc-server
A library to provide services through xml-rpc

## License
MIT Style, see LICENSE.txt

## Notes
currently this requires the current Psr DRAFT for a caching standard, this is supposed to be replaced by using
the interface provided once php-fig has released the real standard. Until then this package will depend on devedge/stubs,
which includes a copy of the psr interface as well as a null implementation of that and psr/log.
